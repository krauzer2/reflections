How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By filtering the different lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    see what worked and what didn't

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro better organized.
    Con may wish you had commited a specific version

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is more logical to group files that are associated with each other and hence, versions. 
	Google Docs, however may choose this approach, for more clear and direct indication that a file has changed,how many versions are, the frequency of changing it may indicate complexity or disambiguation etc. Also there might be the reason that all but a few files are production stage and need no further versions.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to view history of commits including ids,authors,messages,date of commit. git diff to vie the differences between to commits  using their ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you wouldn't lose much given that you can always revert to the previous version and using git checkout find the commit that worked 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    this course
